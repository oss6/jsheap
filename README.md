# jsheap
Binary heaps implementation in Javascript

A binary heap is a complete binary tree which satisfies the heap ordering property. The ordering can be one of two types:
- the **min-heap** property: the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent, with the minimum-value element at the root.
- the **max-heap** property: the value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its parent, with the maximum-value element at the root.
